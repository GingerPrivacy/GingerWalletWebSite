  "about-1": "We believe the most urgent issue facing humanity is fixing the monetary system, with Bitcoin being the best solution and privacy as its biggest challenge.",
  "about-2": "Ginger Wallet was created to help Bitcoin retain its cypherpunk principles on its journey to becoming a global reserve currency and to address the inherent privacy issues of its public ledger. This is why Ginger Wallet is an open-source, non-custodial, privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet for desktop that implements trustless coinjoin technology.",
  "about-3": "After years of privacy research and development, we’ve realized that having good tools is not enough—they must also be easy to use. Otherwise, they will only be utilized by a minority, making those users stand out. To encourage the adoption of these tools, Ginger is designed to be user-friendly and to provide privacy automatically by default.",

  "title-help": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faq1": "WHAT IS A “COINJOIN”?",
  "faq1-text": "<p>A coinjoin is a collaborative transaction between multiple peers.</p><p>Usually, but not necessarily, it consists of some standard output denominations that participants should break their coins in to. This makes it difficult for outside parties to trace where a particular coin was sent to (as opposed to regular bitcoin transactions, where there is usually one sender and one receiver).</p><p>Coinjoins can be done with non-custodial software like Ginger Wallet, that eliminates the risk of funds disappearing or being stolen. The funds will always be in a bitcoin address that the user controls and not even developers can alter the transaction or redirect the funds.</p><p>Coinjoin basically means: “when you want to make a transaction, find someone else who also wants to make a transaction and make a joint transaction together”.</p>",
  "faq2": "WHAT ARE THE FEES FOR COINJOINS?",
  "faq2-text": "<p>Coinjoining coins with a value above 0,03 BTC costs 0.3% as a coordinator fee + mining fees. Inputs of 0,03 BTC or below don't pay coordinator fees, nor do remixes, even after one transaction. Thus, a payment made with coinjoined funds allows the sender and the recipient to remix their coins without paying any coordinator fees.</p>",
  "faq3": "DO I NEED TO TRUST GINGER WITH MY COINS?",
  "faq3-text": "<p>No, Ginger’s coinjoin implementation is trustless by design. The participants do not need to trust each other or the coordinator. Since only the user knows the private keys, only he can sign the transaction, which will only be done after verifying that everything is alright. Nobody can neither steal your coins, nor figure out which outputs belong to which inputs.</p>",
  "faq4": "DOES GINGER SUPPORT HARDWARE WALLETS?",
  "faq4-text": "<p>Ginger does support hardware wallet usage through the standard Bitcoin-core HWI, although coinjoining straight from or to a hardware wallet is not yet possible.</p><p>Here's a <a href='https://github.com/GingerPrivacy/GingerWallet/blob/master/WalletWasabi.Documentation/WasabiCompatibility.md#officially-supported-hardware-wallets' target='_blank'>list</a> of the officially supported hardware wallets.</p>",
  "faq5": "IS THERE AN ANDROID/IOS VERSION?",
  "faq5-text": "<p>No. Ginger’s features, like coinjoin, require considerable computational power, which are currently not replicable on a smartphone.</p>",
  "faq6": "DOES GINGER SUPPORT ALTCOINS?",
  "faq6-text": "<p>There are countless reasons why it is the only logical choice to be bitcoin-only. With Bitcoin we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to manifest libre sound money. If we succeed, then an utmost beautiful agora of sovereign individuals may emerge. If we fail, then this will conjure up the most horrific Orwellian nightmare. There is no room for wasted time and energy, this great work requires our full attention. Any line of code written to support a random shitcoin takes away scarce developer time to work on real problems.</p>",
  "faq7": "WHAT ARE THE MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS TO RUN GINGER?",
  "faq7-text": "<p>Ginger runs in most operating systems with 64-bit architecture.</p><p>For the complete list of all the officially supported operating systems, click <a href='https://github.com/GingerPrivacy/GingerWallet/blob/master/WalletWasabi.Documentation/WasabiCompatibility.md#officially-supported-operating-systems' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>",
  "faq8": "DO I NEED TO RUN TOR?",
  "faq8-text": "<p>All Ginger network traffic goes via Tor by default -there's no need to set up Tor by yourself. If you do already have Tor, and it is running, then Ginger will try to use that first. </p><p> You can turn off Tor in the Settings. Note that in this case you are still private, except when you coinjoin and when you broadcast a transaction. In the first case, the coordinator would know the links between your inputs and outputs based on your IP address. In the second case, if you happen to broadcast a transaction of yours to a full node that is spying on you, it will know the link between your transaction and your IP address.</p>",
  "faq9": "WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO USE A NEW ADDRESS FOR EVERY PAYMENT?",
  "faq9-text": "<p>Addresses being used more than once is very damaging to privacy because that links together more blockchain transactions with proof that they were created by the same entity. The most private and secure way to use bitcoin is to send a brand new address to each person who pays you. After an address has received a coin, it should never be used again. Also, a brand new bitcoin address should be demanded from the recipient when sending bitcoin. Ginger has a user interface which discourages address reuse by removing from the GUI addresses which have received a coin.</p><p>It has been argued that the phrase 'bitcoin address' was a bad name for this object because it implies it can be reused like an email address. A better name would be something like 'bitcoin invoice'.</p><p>Bitcoin isn't anonymous but pseudonymous, and the pseudonyms are bitcoin addresses. Avoiding address reuse is like throwing away a pseudonym after it has been used.</p>",
  "faq10": "WHAT IS THE PASSPHRASE USED FOR?",
  "faq10-text": "<p>The passphrase you set is used as a 13th seed word (as described in <a href='https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki' target='_blank'>BIP 39</a>) and to encrypt the private key of the extended private key (as described in <a href='https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0038.mediawiki' target='_blank'>BIP 38</a>) to get an encrypted secret which is stored on the computer.</p><p>Ginger Wallet stores only the BIP38 encrypted blob, so you'll need to type in the passphrase to spend or coinjoin from the wallet.</p><p>The passphrase will unlock your bitcoin to anyone who has access to the recovery words backup or the computer! If your backup gets compromised, this passphrase is the only thing protecting your precious sats.</p><p>It is important to use a random and long passphrase.</p>",
  "faq11": "WHAT IS THE DEFAULT 2FA STATE OF GINGERWALLET?",
  "faq11-text": "<p>By default, GingerWallet operates without 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication), allowing users to use the wallet anonymously.</p>",
  "faq12": "HOW DO I ENABLE 2FA IN GINGERWALLET?",
  "faq12-text": "<strong>To enable 2FA:</strong> <ul><li>Go to Settings -> Security</li><li>Toggle the 2FA switch to 'On'</li><li>A QR code will appear in a pop-up window for the next steps.</li></ul><p>To use 2FA features in GingerWallet, you need to enable Tor. Since GingerWallet now operates with a new working folder, it's recommended to delete the old Wasabi working folder if it's no longer in use, as the files stored there are unencrypted.</p><p><strong>Important: Delete your old working folder only if the GingerWallet folder is in the same location and your updated app is functioning properly.</strong></p><strong>To delete old working folder on different systems:</strong><ul><li>Windows: /Users/{your username}/AppData/Roaming/WalletWasabi/Client</li><li>Linux: /home/{your username}/.walletwasabi/client</li><li>macOS: /Users/{your username}/.walletwasabi/client</li></ul><p>You cannot manually add 2FA to your auth folder using only a QR code.</p>",
  "faq13": "HOW DO I SET UP 2FA USING AN AUTHENTICATOR APP?",
  "faq13-text": "<strong>Once the QR code appears:</strong><ul><li>Scan it using a mobile authenticator app like Google Authenticator, 2FAS Auth, Aegis Authenticator, FreeOTP.</li><li>Make sure your authenticator app supports sha256 and 8 digit authentication if your are not using any from the previous examples</li><li>Enter the current PIN code displayed in your authenticator app into the input field below the QR code.</li><li>After verifying the PIN code, 2FA will be activated.</li></ul>",
  "faq14": "WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE 2FA_INFO.GWS FILE?",
  "faq14-text": "<p>The <strong>2fa_info.gws file</strong> is an encrypted file that ensures the security of your wallet. Once 2FA is activated, this file is created on your device, and all existing and future wallets will be encrypted automatically.</p>",
  "faq15": "DO I NEED TO RESTART THE APPLICATION AFTER ENABLING 2FA?",
  "faq15-text": "<p>Yes, after activating 2FA, GingerWallet must be restarted for the changes to take effect.</p>",
  "faq16": "HOW DOES THE LOGIN PROCESS CHANGE AFTER ENABLING 2FA?",
  "faq16-text": "<strong>After restarting the application:</strong><ul><li>A pop-up window will request the current PIN code from your authenticator app at startup.</li><li>Enter the PIN code, and upon successful verification, the system will decode and load your wallet files.</li></ul>",
  "faq17": "HOW DO I DISABLE 2FA?",
  "faq17-text": "<strong>To disable 2FA:</strong><ul><li>Navigate to Settings -> Security</li> <li>Toggle the 2FA switch to 'Off.'</li><li>The system will deactivate 2FA and decode all wallet files.</li></ul>",
  "faq18": "WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I CHANGE DEVICES OR LOSE DATA?",
  "faq18-text": "<strong>In case of a device change or data loss:</strong><ul><li>Reinstall GingerWallet on the new device.</li><li>Restore your wallets using the securely stored seed words.</li> <li>You will need to set up 2FA again (if desired).</li></ul>",
